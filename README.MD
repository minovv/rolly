Rolly - Easy Rolling Life

# About

This app helps users achieve their goals and manage their tasks by categorizing tasks based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs and using the Eisenhower Method of prioritization. Users can create goals, associate them with tasks, categorize their tasks into one of five categories of Maslow's hierarchy (Physiological, Safety, Love/Belonging, Esteem, and Self-actualization), and track their progress towards fulfilling their needs and completing their goals.

## Features

* Create goals: Users can create goals and associate them with one of five categories of Maslow's hierarchy (Physiological, Safety, Love/Belonging, Esteem, and Self-actualization).

* Manage tasks: Users can create main tasks and secondary tasks associated with each goal, and manage their tasks with ease.

* Prioritize tasks: Users can categorize their tasks into one of four priority levels (urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, not important and not urgent) based on the Eisenhower Method.

* Track progress: Users can see how far they have progressed towards fulfilling their needs and completing their goals, and mark tasks as complete as they complete them.

* View reports: Users can view reports and charts that help them see their progress over time and identify areas where they need to improve.
